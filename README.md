#Interpol

##A lightweight tweening library for the interpolation of values over time

**Author:** *Joe Harlow* (<joe@f5.io>)

`Interpol` is a JavaScript tweening library built on top of `requestAnimationFrame`. `Interpol` is purely used for the interpolation of values over time and should be used with higher-level libraries to facilitate the animation of elements.

###Browser Support
---

`Interpol` is built on `requestAnimationFrame` but will fall back to a simple `setTimeout` method for unsupported browsers. It will therefore work in most browsers.

- Microsoft Internet Explorer 8+
- Mozilla Firefox 3.6+
- Google Chrome 5.0+
- Apple Safari 5.0+
- Opera 10.6+

###Installation
---
`Interpol` can be installed with either `npm` or `bower`, by running:

`npm install interpol` or `bower install interpol` respectively.
